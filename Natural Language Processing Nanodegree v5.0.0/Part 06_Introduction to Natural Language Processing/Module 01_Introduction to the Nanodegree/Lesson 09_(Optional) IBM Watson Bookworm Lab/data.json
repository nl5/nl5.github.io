Create and configure Discovery service\n\n- **Prepare an environment**: Notebook connects to a Discovery service instance and creates/fetches an environment.\n- **Test configuration**: The service processes a small sample text and returns enriched output.\n- **Analyze test output**: All inline questions are answered correctly based on the output, and a word-cloud of keywords is shown.\n\n### 2. Ingest documents\n\n- **Prepare a document collection**: A collection is created and documents are added to it, one document per paragraph of text.\n- **Test query**: A simple query is made against the collection, and relevant results are returned. Inline questions are answered correctly.\n\n### 3. Parse natural language questions\n\n- **Add intents**: At least 3 intents are added to the Conversation service, each with at least 5 example utterances. Inline questions are answered adequately.\n\n- **Add entities**: At least 3 entities are added to the Conversation service, each with at least 1 example entity. Inline questions are answered adequately.\n\n- **Design dialog flow**: An appropriate dialog flow has been designed using the Conversation service workspace tool, with at least 3 nodes. Inline questions are answered adequately.\n\n- **Test dialog**: A simple 1-question dialog is demonstrated in the notebook, showing what node was triggered.\n\n### 4. Query document collection to fetch answers\n\n- **Process sample question**: A sample question is run through the Conversation service. The intent and entities identified are extracted, and optionally the dialog node that was triggered.\n\n- **Query the collection**: A query is designed based on the information extracted in the previous step, and run against the Discovery service collection.\n\n- **Process returned results**: Results obtained from the Discovery service are processed to provide a specific response to the natural language question that was asked.\n\n### 5. Reflections\n\n- **Reflections**: Inline question adequately answered, including strengths and weaknesses of an API-based solution like this.\n\n### (Optional) Extensions\n\n- Try with a different dataset (submit data files along with the notebook, or include instructions on how to fetch them).\n- Deploy as a Bluemix application.",
