00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
So, let's unfold the model in time,

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.630
and clean the sketch a bit,

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.629
and focus on the third time step.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.550
In this model, we have three weight matrices that we want to modify.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.789
The weight matrix Wx linking the network inputs to the state or the hidden layer,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.679
the weight matrix Ws connecting one stage to the next,

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.024
and the weight matrix Wy connecting this data to the output.

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:34.049
Let's start with adjusting Wy,

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.125
which is the most straightforward to obtain.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:39.539
At time T equals 3,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.420
the derivative of the squared error with respect to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.859
Wy is found by a simple one step chain rule,

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.975
and equals to the derivative of the squared error with respect to the output,

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:57.814
multiplied by the derivative of the output with respect to the weight matrix Wy.

00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:00.329
As always, these derivatives will be

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.670
calculated according to each element of the weight matrix.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.989
To adjust the other two matrices,

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:11.034
we will need to use Backpropagation Through Time,

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:14.989
and it doesn't matter which one we choose to adjust first.

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:19.574
Let's choose to focus on the weight matrix Ws,

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:22.995
the weight matrix connecting one state to the next,

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:26.359
and remove anything we don't need from the sketch.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:32.715
At first glance, it may seem that when finding the derivative with respect to Ws,

00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:36.210
we only need to consider state S3.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.869
This way the derivative of timestep, T equals 3,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.925
simply equals the derivative of the squared error with respect to the output,

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:49.825
multiplied by the derivative of the output with respect to S3,

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:56.234
and multiplied by the derivative of S3 with respect to the Matrix Ws.

00:01:56.234 --> 00:02:04.155
But S3 also depends on S2 and S1 the previous states.

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:06.573
So, we can't really stop there.

00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:08.609
We also need to take into account,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.635
what has happened before,

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:15.569
and add to that contribution to our calculation.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.609
So, we will continue calculating the gradient,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.845
knowing that we need to accumulate the contributions,

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:26.479
originating from each of the previous states.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.780
When we consider S2,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.365
we have the following path contributing to the backpropagation.

00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:39.235
We can clearly see that S3 depends on S2,

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:43.570
giving us the derivative calculations using the chain rule,

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.215
all the way back to the derivative of S2 with respect to the matrix Ws.

00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:51.950
But we're not done yet,

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:57.039
we need to go one more step back to the first state S1,

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.984
giving us the calculations again by using the chain rule,

00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:08.045
all the way back to the derivative of S1 with respect to the matrix Ws.

00:03:08.044 --> 00:03:10.864
So, let's look again at

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:16.215
the accumulative gradient we now have by using Backpropagation Through Time,

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:21.180
which we calculated considering all the state vectors that we have,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.810
state vector S3, state vector S2,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.075
and state vector S1.

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:32.879
Generally, speaking we consider multiple time steps back,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.259
and need a general framework to define Backpropagation Through Time,

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:41.165
for the purpose of changing Ws.

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:43.555
So, what's next?

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:49.000
In our next video we will focus on adjusting the weight matrix Wx.
