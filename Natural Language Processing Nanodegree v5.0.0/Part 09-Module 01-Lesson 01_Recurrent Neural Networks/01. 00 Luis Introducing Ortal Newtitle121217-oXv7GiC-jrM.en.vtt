Hello. For the next section in recurrent neural networks,

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:05.830
I am very excited to introduce you to my colleague Ortal.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:05.969
Hi Luis.

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:09.754
Hi Ortal. Talking to us from the academic world.

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:12.580
She has a Ph.D. in computer engineering and spent years as

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.589
a university professor and researcher in

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.160
the field of applied cryptography and embedded platforms.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.410
She also worked on the design and analysis of

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.175
intelligent algorithms for high speed custom digital architectures.

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:27.100
Thank you Luis. Hi everyone.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.885
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:32.545
I got into machine learning through my research in embedded systems.

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:35.820
Since then, I've developed a passion for deep learning and in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.770
particular recurrent neural networks or RNNs in short.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.239
RNNs are widely used in many applications such as speech recognition,

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:46.875
machine translation and video analysis.

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:49.859
In this lesson, Luis and I will be breaking down

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.755
these concepts for you and teaching you how such systems work.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:55.510
Ready to go?
