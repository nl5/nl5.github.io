00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
The unfolding in time scheme can be confusing.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.232
So let's go back for a bit,

00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:07.349
look at it closely,

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.195
and see what's actually going on there.

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:13.400
First, we will take the Elman network,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.195
and tilted by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:23.310
As in RNNs, we usually display the flow of information from the bottom to the top.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.324
In the case of a single hidden layer without stacking further,

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:32.109
this is how the unfolded model may look like.

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:33.856
At any given time t,

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.405
we will have an input vector X of t,

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:41.850
connected to the state by the weight matrix WX.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.725
State vector S of t minus one,

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:48.285
connected to the state by the weight matrix WS,

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:52.372
X of t and s of t minus one together,

00:00:52.372 --> 00:00:56.094
helped produce the desired state vector S of t,

00:00:56.094 --> 00:01:04.890
weight matrix WY in return helps produce the output vector Y of t. Now,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.954
at time t plus one,

00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:10.090
the system will have two different input vectors,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.635
vector X of t plus one,

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.045
and the previous state vector S of t,

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:20.769
which was our hidden layer activation in the previous time step.

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:25.563
But the weights remained the same as it's the same system,

00:01:25.563 --> 00:01:27.484
only at a different time.

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:30.359
To avoid messy sketches,

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:36.269
we can use the unfolded scheme which is visibly cleaner with fewer connecting lines.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:41.560
So to present the system time t plus one and so on,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.585
we can simply connect it this way.

00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:45.375
Add the weights to the sketch,

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.930
and we have our complete unfolded system where

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.745
each arrow represents a few if not many variables.

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:57.300
Understanding this principle, and realizing

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.629
that we can stack up any arbitrary number of layers,

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:06.030
enables the easy sketching of RNN networks of any number of layers.
