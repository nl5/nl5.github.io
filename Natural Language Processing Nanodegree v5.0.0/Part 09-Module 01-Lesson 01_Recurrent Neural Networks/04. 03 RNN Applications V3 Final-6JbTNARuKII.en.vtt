00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.769
To give you an idea of how useful RNNs and LSTMs are let's take a sneak peek.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:13.349
The world's leading tech companies are all using RNNs and LSTMs in their applications.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.445
Let's take a look at some of those.

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:19.425
Speech recognition, where a sequence of data samples

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:24.480
extracted from an audio signal is continuously mapped to text.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.789
Good examples are Google Assistant,

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.699
Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.399
and Nuance's Dragon solutions.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.644
All of these use RNNs as a part of their speech recognition software.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:40.560
Time series predictions, where we predict traffic patterns

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.804
on specific roads to help drivers optimize their driving paths,

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:46.335
like they do in Waze,

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:50.310
or predicting what movie a consumer will want to watch next,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.795
like they do in Netflix.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:55.635
Predicting stock price movements based on historical patterns

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:59.375
of stock movements and potentially other market conditions,

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.710
that change over time.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.590
This is practiced by most quantitive hedge funds.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.076
Natural Language Processing or NLP in short,

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:13.334
such as machine translation used by Google or Salesforce for example.

00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:16.579
Question answering like Google Analytics,

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.659
if you've got a question about your app,

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.969
you'll soon be able to ask Google Analytics directly.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.679
Have you heard of chatbots?

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.250
Many companies such as Google, Baidu, and,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.769
Slack are using RNNs to drive

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:32.439
their Natural Language Processing engines for such applications.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.090
And of course, there are many other NLP applications.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.389
The last application we will focus on is gesture recognition,

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:45.364
where we observe a sequence of video frames to determine which gesture the user has made.

00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:49.685
For example, waiving your right arm or swinging it.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.560
Here are a few gesture recognition technology companies

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.040
and companies that are applying gesture recognition to their products.
