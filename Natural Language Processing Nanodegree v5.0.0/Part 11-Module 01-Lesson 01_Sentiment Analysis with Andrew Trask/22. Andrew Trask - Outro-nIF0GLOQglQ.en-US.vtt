00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
In this course, we tackled six different

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.609
projects. We started by curing dataset

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.350
and developing a predictive theory

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.179
so that the neural networks would be

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.099
able to identify correlation between the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.410
input and output data. We've been

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.179
validated this theory us  ing some simple

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.250
count based heuristics and found we were

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.750
able to identify words with both

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.789
positive and negative correlation to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.220
output data. However, when we train our

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.470
first network on this data, it was only

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.090
barely able to find correlation,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.539
struggling to cut through the noise. So

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.488
what we did next we increase the amount

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:33.930
of signal and decrease the amount of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.460
noise and found that each time we did

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.110
this, our network was able to converge

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.360
much much faster. Whereas our first

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.430
network struggle to convert all, barely

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.350
reaching accuracy of sixty percent, and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.730
only running it around a rate of a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.440
hundred reviews per second.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.350
Our final network was able to classify a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.090
tell accuracy level eighty-six percent,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.239
and went to knit properly was able to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.690
classify 7,000 views per second. Helping

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.309
you find a piece these tools and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.629
techniques for framing a problem are

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.309
incredibly general. Whenever you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.660
encounter a new dataset, you're going to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.830
need to come up with a new predictive

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.110
theory, and then tune and tweet your

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.119
model in your data set to make the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.010
correlation your data most obvious to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.360
the neural network, so they can protect

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.090
both quickly and accurately. Hope you've

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.080
enjoyed this tutorial, and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.729
hope you can continute to enjoy your Udacity

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.200
course. Now let's go back to the classroom.
