00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.179
The next thing to do is create
our training, validation,

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:05.549
and test sets.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.019
This is something
you're probably

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.149
going to have to do for
every network you build,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.230
so it's good practice to
do this for every data

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.339
set you're using.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.550
And I found that a
lot of, basically

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.969
like every different data set
has a different way to do this.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.339
Just because things
are different

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.870
shapes, and the
way that you want

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.510
to put your data into
your network is different.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.090
So you end up having
to do this in a lot

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.250
of different ways, many times.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.210
So typically with this, you
have some split fraction

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.359
where you define like what's
the fraction of my data

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.009
that I want to keep
in the test set.

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.699
Most of the time this is
usually like 0.8 or 0.9.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.150
So here I split the
data into a training set

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.449
for the features, a validation
set for the features,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.250
and then training for the
labels, and validation

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.210
for the labels.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.490
And then from there,
split the validation

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.020
set into a smaller validation
set and a test set,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.230
and another validation for the
labels and test for the labels.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.936
If you do this right, these
are the shape of the features

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:07.769
that you should see.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:11.939
So like the train x,
validation x, and test x,

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.269
should be these sizes.
