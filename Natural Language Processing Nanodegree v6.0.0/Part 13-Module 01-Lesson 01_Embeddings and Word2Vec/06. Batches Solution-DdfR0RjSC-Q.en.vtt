Hey there, welcome back. So, now,

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:06.120
here's my solution for the get_target function.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.490
So the first thing I did is generate our random window R so using random.randint.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.179
So, we want to go from one to our window size,

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:18.058
but when you actually, like,

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.274
do randint, it's not inclusive,

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:22.039
so you wouldn't get,

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.280
like, if your window size is five,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.892
you would actually only get integers from one to four,

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.620
so you just have to add a plus one here to actually

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.675
make sure you get Integers from one to five.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:34.795
Then, we want to get like the start index,

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:39.405
so that's just whatever index we're at minus R. And then you have to do this kind of

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:44.579
edge case thing where if index minus R is less than zero,

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.719
then you want to set that to zero,

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.179
because you can get something like if index minus is -2,

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.465
then you're gonna kind of wrap around from the back

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:55.225
of your word list and that's gonna mess things up.

00:00:55.225 --> 00:01:00.329
So, then, the stop of our window is index plus R. So now,

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.655
we have our window, we have like the start and we have the stop.

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:05.655
So, to get the target words,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:11.280
we just look from words from start to where we are,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.849
index, and then we look â€“ so this is like

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:19.349
the words in the history of our text and this is the words in the future of our text.

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:24.069
So, we're looking at the words from index plus one to stop plus one.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.969
And then I'm wrapping this in a set because

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:29.839
sets just automatically get rid of duplicates.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.150
So if we have duplicate words in this window,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.739
then it's just gonna automatically get

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:36.685
rid of them and then we're gonna have our target words.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:40.030
Then we just return this as a list because this is a set,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.108
and so we just convert this into a list and return that.

00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:45.000
All right. See you in the next video.
