00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
So, just a quick note about PyTorch.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:05.790
The features I'm demonstrating in this lesson,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.760
are only available from PyTorch 1.0.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.785
At the time I am recording these videos,

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:15.570
hydro 20.0 is not the stable version of PyTorch.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.940
So, if you install PyTorch the normal way,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.560
so you go to their website,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.080
and you click on all these stuff, and you choose Stable,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
you're actually going to get PyTorch version 0.4.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.765
So, if you want to use these new features,

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.540
right now, you need to click on preview, over here.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.525
Once you do that, you can choose your appropriate platform,

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:34.890
how you want to install it,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.035
and then you copy this command,

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:38.535
and run it in your terminal.

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:40.230
So, you have just to keep this in mind;

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.220
if you're trying to use these new features,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.580
and for some reason they're not available,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.700
be sure to check what version of PyTorch you're using.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.890
So, you'll need to use at least,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.870
PyTorch 1.0, to actually use these new scripting,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930
and tracing features. Cheers.
