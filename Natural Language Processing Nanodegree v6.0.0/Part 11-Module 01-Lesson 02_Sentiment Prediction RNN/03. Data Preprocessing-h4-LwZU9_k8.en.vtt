00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
So now that we have all the
words, what we need to do

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:06.160
is we need to encode all
of our views as integers.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.141
So we're going to
pass in the reviews

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.099
where every word is an
integer and that's going

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.144
to go into our embedding layer.

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:15.269
So the first step, which
I'm going to leave to you,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.050
is to create a dictionary that
is mapping these vocabulary

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.539
words into integers.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.789
And one thing to know
is that later we're

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.299
going to be padding our
input vectors with zeros.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.266
So that means that when we
convert our words to integers,

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.390
they have to start at one,
they can't start at zero

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.579
or the network's
going to get confused.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.159
So then once you
have this mapping,

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.519
then you should
convert our reviews,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.280
from like that list of
reviews, convert all the words

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.880
into integers.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.429
So now we have all our reviews,
but instead of words we

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:48.469
have integers.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.170
OK.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.530
And then next, we need
to change our labels

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.939
from positive and negative
into ones and zeros.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:00.359
So our labels, if
you open it up,

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.789
each review is
labeled with a string.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.239
Either positive or negative.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.939
But we need those to
be ones and zeros,

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.819
so that we can actually
use it in our network

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.469
and calculate the cost.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.750
So you can do that here, also.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.609
And so if you built
labels correctly,

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:17.370
then what you should see
if you run this cell,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.666
is that there's actually one
review that has no length.

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:23.039
I'm not really sure why, I
didn't look into it very much,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.870
but it's the
problem because it's

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.073
going to end up kind of
breaking things later.

00:01:27.073 --> 00:01:28.239
So we need to get rid of it.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:31.539
Secondly, there's some
really long reviews in here.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.969
So one of them is, the longest
one is 2,514 words long.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.269
So that is pretty,
that is really long

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:42.899
and it's much too long
to put into our RNN

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.010
because it is going to take
a really long time to train

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.375
that many steps in
our current network.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:51.750
So what we're
going to do instead

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.329
is just truncate
every review down

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.359
to 200 steps, or 200 words.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.510
So for reviews shorter
than 200 words,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.810
we can just pad to
the left with zeros.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.919
So for instance if, you
can kind of see down here,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.979
so if the review is
like best movie ever,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.820
then in numbers that would
the 117, 18, and 128.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.051
Then this row would
look like zero zero

00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:25.109
zero zero for 197 zeros, and
then the last three numbers

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.750
are the integers
corresponding to the words.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.479
Like that.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:30.000
But the first thing
I want you to do

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.020
is remove the review
that has zero length.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.020
So you can do that here.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.290
And then next create
this array features

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.909
that contains the data
we'll pass to the network.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.960
So there's going to be
one row for each review,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.320
and then there's going to
be 200 steps, or 200 words,

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.539
in each row.

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.989
And then, like I was
saying before, if you

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.879
have a review that's less than
200 words, pad it to the left

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:56.699
with zeros.

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.439
And then if it's
more than 200 words,

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.710
just use the first 200 words
as this feature vector.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.610
So if you built
features correctly,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.110
it should look
something like this.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.640
So for the first review, we
just get a bunch of zeros,

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.699
and then here is our review.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.969
Then this is what it looks
like for a review that

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.663
had more than 200 characters.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:17.579
So it looks like this.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.090
Where like this
200 element vector

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.900
is completely filled
out with no padding.
