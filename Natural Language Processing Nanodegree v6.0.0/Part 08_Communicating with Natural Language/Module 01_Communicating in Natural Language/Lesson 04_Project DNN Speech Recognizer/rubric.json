Build your own language model from scratch, or leverage a repository or toolkit that you find online to improve your predictions.\n\n## (2) Train on Bigger Data\n\nIn the project, you used some of the smaller downloads from the LibriSpeech corpus.  Try training your model on some larger datasets - instead of using `dev-clean.tar.gz`, download one of the larger training sets on the [website](http://www.openslr.org/12/).\n\n## (3) Try out Different Audio Features\n\nIn this project, you had the choice to use _either_ spectrogram or MFCC features.  Take the time to test the performance of _both_ of these features.  For a special challenge, train a network that uses raw audio waveforms!",
