These workspaces provide a Jupyter notebook server directly in your browser. This lesson will briefly introduce the Workspaces interface.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- Workspaces sessions are connections from your browser to a remote server. Each student has a limited number of GPU hours allocated on the servers (the allocation is significantly more than completing the projects is expected to take). There is currently no limit on the number of Workspace hours when GPU mode is disabled.\n- Workspace data stored in the user's home folder is preserved between sessions (and can be reset as needed, e.g., to get project updates).\n- **Only 3 gigabytes of data can be stored in the home folder.**\n- Workspace sessions are preserved if your connection drops or your browser window is closed, simply return to the classroom and re-open the workspace page; however, workspace sessions are automatically terminated after a period of inactivity. This will prevent you from leaving a session connection open and burning through your time allocation. (See the section on active connections below.)\n- The kernel state is preserved as long as the notebook session remains open, but it is _not_ preserved if the session is closed. If you exit the notebook for more than half an hour and the session is closed, you will need to re-run any previously-run cells before continuing.\n\n## Overview\n---",

We have provided a utility that can keep your workspace sessions active for these tasks. However, keep the following guidelines in mind:\n\n- Do not try to permanently hold the workspace session active when you do not have a process running (e.g., do not try to hold the session open in the background)—the limits are in place to preserve your GPU time allocation; there is no guarantee that you'll receive additional time if you exceed the limit.  \n- Make sure that you save the results of the long running task to disk as soon as the task ends (e.g., checkpoint your model parameters for deep learning networks); otherwise the workspace will disconnect 30 minutes after the active process ends, and the results will be lost.\n\nThe `workspace_utils.py` module (available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5b06f6c2_workspace-utils/workspace-utils.py)) includes an iterator wrapper called `keep_awake` and a context manager called `active_session` that can be used to maintain an active session during long-running processes. The two functions are equivalent, so use whichever fits better in your code.  **NOTE:** The file may be incorrectly downloaded as `workspace-utils.py` (note the dash instead of an underscore in the filename). Make sure to correct the filename before uploading to your workspace; Python cannot import from file names including hyphens.\n\nExample using `keep_awake`:\n```\nfrom workspace_utils import keep_awake\n\nfor i in keep_awake(range(5)):  #anything that happens inside this loop will keep the workspace active\n    # do iteration with lots of work here\n```\n\nExample using `active_session`:\n```\nfrom workspace_utils import active_session\n\nwith active_session():\n    # do long-running work here\n```\n\n## Submitting a Project\n---",

              "text": "## Best Practices\n---\nFollow the best practices outlined below to avoid common issues with Workspaces.\n\n- ### Keep your home folder small\n**Your home folder (including subfolders) must be less than 2GB** or you may lose data when your session terminates. You may use directories outside of the home folder for more space, but only the contents of the home folder are persisted between sessions and submitted with your project.\n<br><br>\n**NOTE:** **Your home folder (including subfolders) must be less than 25 megabytes to submit as a project.** If the site becomes unresponsive when you try to submit your project, it is likely that your home folder is too large. You can check the size of your home folder by opening a terminal and running the command `du -h . | tail -1` You can use `ls` to list the files in your terminal and `rm` to remove unwanted files. (Search for both commands online to find example usage.)\n\n  - ##### What's the \"home folder\"?\n\"Home folder\" refers to the directory where users files are stored (compared to locations where system files are stored, for example). (Ref. Wikipedia: [home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory)) In Workspaces, the home folder is `/home/workspace`. Any files in this folder or any subfolder are part of your home folder contents, which means they're saved between sessions and transferred automatically when you switch between CPU/GPU mode.\n<br><br>\nThe folder `/tmp` is _not_ in the home folder; files in any folder outside your home folder are **not** persisted between sessions or transferred between CPU/GPU mode. You can create a folder outside the home folder using the command `mkdir` from a terminal. For example you could create a temporary folder to store data using `mkdir -p /data` to create a folder at the root directory. You will need to recreate the folder and recreate any data inside every time you start a new Workspace session.\n\n- ### Keeping your connection alive during long processes\nWorkspaces automatically disconnect when the connection is inactive for about 30 minutes, which includes inactivity while deep learning models are training. You can use the workspace_utils.py module [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5b0dea96_workspace-utils/workspace-utils.py) to keep your connection alive during training. The module provides a context manager and an iterator wrapper—see example use below.\n<br><br>\n**NOTE:** The script sometimes raises a connection error if the request is opened too frequently; just restart the jupyter kernel & run the cells again to reset the error.\n<br><br>\n**NOTE:** These scripts will keep your connection alive while the training process is _running_, but the workspace will still disconnect 30 minutes after the last notebook cell finishes. Modify the notebook cells to **save your work** at the end of the last cell or else you'll lose all progress when the workspace terminates.\n\n**Example using context manager:**\n```python\nfrom workspace_utils import active_session\n\nwith active_session():\n    # do long-running work here\n```\n\n**Example using iterator wrapper:**\n```python\nfrom workspace_utils import keep_awake\n\nfor i in keep_awake(range(5)):\n    # do iteration with lots of work here\n\n```\n\n- ### Manage your GPU time\nIt is important to avoid wasting GPU time in Workspace projects that have GPU acceleration enabled. The benefits of GPU acceleration are most useful when evaluating deep learning models—especially during _training_. In most cases, you can build and test your model (including data pre-processing, defining model architecture, etc.) in CPU mode, then activate GPU mode to accelerate training.\n\n- ### Handling \"Out of Memory\" errors\nThis issue isn't specific to Workspaces, but rather it is an apparent issue between Pytorch & Jupyter, where Jupyter reports \"out of memory\" after a cell crashes. Jupyter holds references to active objects as long as the kernel is running—including objects created before an error is raised. This can cause Jupyter to persist large objects in memory long after they are no longer required. The only known solution so far is to reset the kernel and run the notebook cells again.",
